One of its distinctive features is the vintage appearance it acquires. <\/p><p>Natural scratches, blemishes, and tones are prominently visible on the surface, but these should not be mistaken for flaws. On the contrary, they contribute to the item's elegant aesthetic. If you prefer a smoother look, you can easily remove these scratches by gently wiping the surface with a damp, soft cloth.<\/p>",

        "content": "<p>It's important to avoid machine washing, exposing leather to excessive humidity, or using alcohol-containing wipes, as these can harm the natural texture of the leather. Instead, gently wipe off dust or clean minor stains using a semi-dry cloth or a soft sponge. If water is spilled on your leather item, allow it to air dry naturally without the use of fans or radiators. To maintain the integrity, softness, and elasticity of Crazy Horse leather over time, regularly apply special impregnation agents such as waxes, creams, or oils.<\/p>",
